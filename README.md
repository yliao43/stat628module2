# Stat 628 Module2 Tuesday Group 6

The nicknames: "tutute" is Tianqi Li, "yliao43" is Yejia Liao, and "kateeee11" is Yaxin Deng.

The code folder contains all the codes we write, including the data cleaning and model construction.

The figures folder contains all the figures and tables we draw.

Since the uploading size restriction of Github, the data folder only contains the positive score for JST.


We used html language to display figures side by side in our summary, but the github break the side by side arrangement, so the figures in summary may seems very large and the summary may seems very long. We apologize for the inconvenience.
